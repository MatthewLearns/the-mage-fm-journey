            <div class='blog-post'>
                <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                <p><em>Posted on October 25, 2025</em></p>
                <p>My Footballing & Life philosophy is built on tactical discipline, youth development, and repetition.</p>
                <p>My First Season usually focus on hiring Young Free Transfers and in the current squad while focusing more funding on Scouting Networks and Youth Devolopment.
                    The Second usually follows suit but with a title chasing aggression while embedding the creme de la cremme of the team into the system.
                    The Third Season usually we have either gained promotion or are challenging for titles. At this point of time we are selling to the market 2/3 of the team while maintaining key backbone figures.
                    We will ensure the right tactiacal replacements are scouted for and ensure they are bargains.</p>

                <h2>Backroom Setup</h2>
                <p><em>Youth Investment</em></p>
                <p>Recruiting top-tier scouts & analysts and coaches to support long-term club growth. The Youth Squad will follow and base their playstyles arround the main teams tactics.
                This ensures seemless transition into the main team. The players are aware following league guidelines they always have a position open if the effort is put in. The intention of the Youth Squad is focused on growing talent and skillsets.</p>

                <h2>Tactical Setup</h2>
                <p><em>Posted on October 26, 2025</em></p>
                <p>There is no blueprint to beating all teams. 
                    To counter a possession based team you do not allow them to have the ball. To beat a high line team you need long balls.
                    So every team will be built with 2 Back Bones. While analysing the opponents system and selecting the most suitable system and making small amendments. This ensures strong and good familiarity with tactics forces perfection and comfortability.</p>

                <h2>Tactical Setup</h2>
                <p><em>Counter-Attack Wing Play</em></p>
                <p>The Focus of this Tactic is to instill fast and aggressive Wings to Counter Attack a team. We use a 4-2-3-1 when we are out of possession and a 2-1-2-3-2 when in possession</p>
                <p>Out Of Possesion(OOP) we absorb the opponents attack only pressing when they are in our half. Allowing opponent crosses to come in and allowing the center backs to take care of them.</p>
                <p>In Possession(IP) the ball starts from the goalkeeper playing short passes from the centerbacks to the Wing Backs to bring the ball forward. Playing with a double headed sword with the CAM playing as a Shadow Striker. The Wingers playing as Inside Forwards will either cut-in and shoot Robben or Ziyech Style or crossing lowballs for the double attack.</p>

                <h2>Tactical Setup</h2>
                <p><em>Possisson Based Press</em></p>
                <p>The Focus of this Tactic is based on Netherlands Total Football. We use a 4-2-3-1 when we are out of possession and a 3-2-4-1 when in possession</p>
                <p>Out Of Possesion(OOP) we press the opponents starting from their goalkeeper preventing short passing out and forcing long balls. The team will press constantly in man-on-man style. While commiting to tackles to maximise defensive capabilities.</p>
                <p>In Possession(IP) the ball starts from the goalkeeper playing short passes from the centerbacks with 1 Full Back staying back to create a 3 CB line, while the other Full Back will join the DM and create a Double DM Pivot. These 2 Defensive will play possesive football among the two lines. The 2 CMs will control possession while allowing 1 Winger to join creating a double attack with the other winger coming in as a CAM. Should the possesion be controlled for long periods of time the CAM will push forward creating a 3 pronged Attack. The target of this is to overload the box encoraging ground through balls with the 2 CMs acting as 2 CAMs.</p>
